If you have an idea for a tutorial, create a file in this folder and make a pull request.
Please note which version of Qonscious you wrote the tutorial for (this will help us port it to future versions).
If your tutorial is about using Qonscious, you can import it from the PiPy registry by doing a `pip install qonscious` (there is no need to install from a repo clone if the newest version works for your case).
